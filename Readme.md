# Function module

Module for representing functions as objects. The functions can be added, multiplied, combined (i.e. combining f(x) and g(x) to the function f(g(x))), and differentiated. 

Functions are defined recursively, using atomic functions as building blocks. The building blocks are the constant function, Log, Sin, Cos, and Exp. The building blocks are combined using the binary operations + - * ^ and the operation (f(x),g(x))-> f(g(x)).
